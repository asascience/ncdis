Hi Patrick, as discussed, here is some code (thanks Ayesha for scripting this) that performs several steps needed to support our regional frequency analysis (RFA).  There will need to be some iteration, e.g., in computation of MHHW (I put in comments).  Also, discussion of what is retained at the end of the analysis which is not necessarily coded right yet, e.g., retain the local sea level trend at the 500-m grids, the MHHW estimate, the 98th percentile threshold, the exceedances (heights and timing) above the threshold.

Anyhow, you mentioned having an employee that knew matlab and python so hopefully this is relatively straightforward.  Anyhow, once you get this scripted, let's try a couple examples to make sure we are on the same page and clarify any outstanding issues.
